# QCMMOCoreIntegration

A simple plugin adding MMOCore conditions and objects to QuestCreator.

Tested only on 1.16 but should work on older mc versions.

Old MMOCore versions won't work due to api changes.

[Check project wiki for list of conditions and objects.](https://github.com/zemoz/QCMMOCoreIntegration/wiki)
